## 1. Project Overview
```
Project Description: KeyGuardian is a secure, personal API key management system that allows developers to store, organize, and access their API keys in a centralized, encrypted vault.

Project Purpose: To solve the common problem of secure API key management for developers, reducing the risk of key exposure and improving organization of credentials across multiple services and projects.

Primary Goals:
1. Create a secure, encrypted storage system for API keys
2. Provide an intuitive interface for managing and categorizing keys
3. Implement OAuth2 authentication for secure access
4. Develop integration capabilities with Story Generator and other projects
5. Establish a foundation for potential premium features

Success Criteria:
- Completed MVP with core functionality for personal use
- Secure encryption of stored API keys
- Intuitive user interface for key management
- Integration with at least one other project (Story Generator)
- Positive feedback from initial users

Key Stakeholders:
- Primary developer
- Story Generator project (as a dependent project)
- Early adopters for testing and feedback
