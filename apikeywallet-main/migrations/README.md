# Migrations Directory

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic and Flask-Migrate.

## Purpose
- Track changes to the database schema over time
- Enable version-controlled, incremental upgrades and downgrades of the database

## Important Files
- `alembic.ini` — Alembic configuration file
- `env.py` — Migration environment setup
- `versions/` — Folder containing individual migration scripts
- `script.py.mako` — Template for autogenerated migration scripts

## How Components Interact
- `env.py` configures the migration context and connects to the database
- Migration scripts in `versions/` define schema changes
- `alembic.ini` provides database connection info and migration settings

## Usage Example
To generate a new migration after changing models:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Add new table"
```

To apply migrations:

```bash
flask db upgrade
